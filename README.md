# Global shocks and emerging countries - disentangling the commodity roller coaster
This repository contains all the data and code necessary to replicate the Ferreira & Valerio (2019) paper "Global shocks and emerging countries - disentangling the commodity roller coaster".

Our code is built upon Tao Zha original work which can be found at www.tzha.net/code, under the section "The Matlab code for structural VARs with linear over-identified restrictions on both current and lagged coefficient". We are grateful to him for sharing his codes and all remaining errors in these codes are due solely to us.

The main code is var_est.m. Type help var_est in Matlab to obtain all relevant information. Be sure to have both data and library folders.

All post estimation analysis is done in R and respective codes are in the R folder.
